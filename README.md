# Multiplayer RPS

#### A mutliplayer rock/paper/scissors game, powered by Firebase & Javascript

## Motivation
This app was created for two reasons. First, to incorporate the real-time power of Google Firebase and create a two-player experience that runs seamlessly. Second, to create a fun and engaging game that is simple, and playable on first glance. The app is designed to be engaging for children, by mimicking the style of a classroom game played on a note pad. Enjoy!
