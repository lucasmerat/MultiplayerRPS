# Multiplayer RPS

#### A mutliplayer rock/paper/scissors game, powered by Firebase & Javascript

## Description
Created for UT Bootcamp, week 7 homework. Goal was to create a two-player gaming experience, utilizing firebase event listeners. In addition, we were tasked with creating a real-time chat feature. 

## Theme
I wanted to create a fun and engaging game that is simple, and playable on first glance. The app is designed to be engaging for children, by mimicking the style of a classroom game played on a note pad. Enjoy!

## Use instructions
To test, open one browser window and set your name, then open a second and set a second name. Switch back and fourth between browser windows and throw rock, paper or scissors.
